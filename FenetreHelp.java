		" Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. " + 
		" The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.\n" + 
		"\n  STARTING A GAME \n" +"\n The white player starts. He can only move one of its pawn one or two squares forward (see moves of pawn). \n"+"\n  HOW PIECES MOVE \n" + " \n Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), " + 
		"and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. " + "Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces"
		+"(by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game. \n"+"\n King:"+ " It can only move one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. "
		+"\n Knight: Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces, going two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90 degree angle, just like the shape of an L. "
		+"\n Bishop: The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color."
		+ "\n Queen:  She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally, as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces."+ "\n Rook: The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides. "
		+ "\n Pawn: Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares. Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They can never move or capture backwards.\n"
		+"\n  CHECK & CHECKMATE \n"+"\n The purpose of the game is to checkmate the opponents king. This happens when the king is put into check and cannot get out of check."+
		" There are only three ways a king can get out of check: move out of the way (though he cannot castle!), block the check with another piece, or capture the piece threatening the king."+
		" If a king cannot escape checkmate then the game is over. Customarily the king is not captured or removed from the board, the game is simply declared over." );
